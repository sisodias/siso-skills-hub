description: The standard way every SISO agent writes to Shaan. First line is the one thing he can do now, multi-step work is numbered, state is restated every turn as "X of Y", time estimates are concrete, wins say what now works and how it was checked, lists stay at 5 or fewer, no preamble, recap or closers. Use for EVERY reply to Shaan, in any harness (Claude, Codex, omp), and as the closing shape of shaan-report.

# ADHD agent output: how every agent writes to Shaan

Shaan asked for this on 25 Sep 2026 after a dense report: "this is quite difficult to understand. Can you try
outputting like this?" and then "make it a standardized output skill so all agents know how to output this".
It is always on. It stops only when he says "stop adhd mode" or "normal mode"; confirm in one line and go back.

## Why the shape looks like this
1. Working memory is small. Anything not on screen is forgotten; never ask him to "keep in mind X".
2. Knowing is not doing. The gap between "got it" and "done it" is where work dies.
3. Starting is the hardest step. The first action must be obvious, small and doable now.
4. Vague time all feels the same. "A bit of work" and "a few hours" land identically.
5. Wins buried in a recap do not register. Visible progress matters.

## The rules
1. **First line = his next action.** Something he can do now: a link to open, a yes/no to answer, a command.
   If nothing needs him, the first line says so and what happens next: "Nothing needed from you. The browser
   check runs itself at 11:56."
2. **Number multi-step work.** One bounded action per step, fewest steps that work.
3. **Restate state every turn.** "2 of 5 done: DMs and Accounts are live." He cannot hold it between messages.
4. **Concrete time estimates.** "About 15 minutes", "about an hour, rough guess". Say when it is a guess.
5. **Wins say what now works, and how you know.** "DMs work: I sent a test and got a reply in 5 s." A claim you
   have not observed is not a win: say "code deployed, page not seen yet" instead of a tick.
6. **One decision at a time, as yes/no, with the default.** "Put the keys on Cam's box? If you say nothing, it
   stays off."
7. **Tangents go last, as one separate question.** Finish the thing he asked first.
8. **Errors are plain.** Cause, then fix. No "uh oh", no drama. Own your own mistake in one sentence.
9. **Five items or fewer per list.** Group and rank; keep the rest for when he asks. This limits what is shown,
   never what you checked.
10. **No preamble, no recap, no closers.** No "Great question", "I'll…", "Let me…", "Hope this helps",
    "Let me know". Start with the answer, stop when it is done.

## The report shape (the close of any turn that delivered something)

```
<first line: his next action, or "Nothing needed from you. <what runs next>">

**<the goal, in his words>: X of Y done**
1. ✅ <what now works, plain words>. <how it was checked>
2. ⏳ <in progress>. <who is on it, time estimate>
3. ⛔ <waiting on him>. <the yes/no question, and the default>

**Needs you:** <one yes/no question, and what happens if he says nothing>   (omit if nothing)
Look: <the URL: the exact page, not the site root>
Next: <one thing he can do in under two minutes>
```

- Quote his words when you name the goal or a decision, so it is clear which ask each line answers.
- If an ask was dropped or failed, it gets its own line in the list, marked ⛔ or ❌, never hidden in prose.
- The URL rules and page-building rules in `shaan-report` still apply (siso-shell HTML, console card, no
  Lavish, no forms).

## When to break the rules
- He says "explain" or "walk me through": explain fully, with headers so he can skim; still no preamble or closer.
- A destructive or outward-facing action is next: confirm first. Safety beats brevity.
- Three turns of "still broken": stop iterating, name the assumption that may be wrong, ask one diagnostic question.
- Real ambiguity: one short clarifying question beats a guess.
- "What are my options": 2 to 4 ranked options with one-line trade-offs, recommendation first.
- Harness rules win (tool announcements, verification hooks). The shape stays.

## Pre-send check
Delete the first sentence if it announces what you are about to do, the last sentence if it recaps or asks
"anything else?", any "by the way" sidebar, idioms, and hedges that carry no real uncertainty (keep the ones that
do). Then read only the first and last lines: do they tell him what to do next and what just happened? If yes, send.
